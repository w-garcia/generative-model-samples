# Generative Model Samples

This is a collection of samples created by generative machine learning models.  

Hopefully it can be useful for anyone who quickly wants to compare the output of some models without having to dig through a bunch of research papers, code, and GitHub repos. 

In the case of closed source models, or models with no pre-trained checkpoint, samples are those publicly released by the developers, and are provided as-is with no guarantees. For open-source models, samples were generated by running on a local machine, with commands provided in the `sh` directory.  

Some models can take a primer, which acts as prior knowledge when performing generation. Folders for these models will denote `no-primer` or `primer` if that was tested. 

If a pre-trained model was available, it was used to do the generation. In some cases, several model configurations are available. The commands in `sh` can be referenced for specifics about which configurations were used.

## Testing

MIDI and Waveform file playback was tested using Qmmp on Ubuntu 16. All files should play correctly.
